## ✨ Project Overview 

**Anki-chan** is an AI-powered extension designed to enhance the traditional spaced-repetition workflow of Anki.
It builds on **AnkiConnect** and provides a richer, more interactive study experience through dynamic questioning, feedback, and card creation.

The core idea is simple:
Instead of only recalling answers silently, learners *teach*, *explain*, and *respond* to AI prompts.
This transforms the review process into an active dialogue that strengthens memory, surfaces uncertainty, and supports deeper understanding.

**Key features include:**

* A clean local web interface for managing AnkiConnect actions
* AI-driven question generation and multi-style prompts for each knowledge point
* Smart feedback that identifies vague or uncertain recall
* Optional AI-assisted card generation and editing
* Extensible design for plugins, desktop pets, and creative learning tools

Anki-chan aims to be a lightweight, privacy-friendly, and highly customizable companion that works entirely on the user’s local machine.
